"""
Local wake-word detection for JARVIS ("Hey Jarvis").

Design goals:
  • ZERO cost when the feature is off — openwakeword is imported ONLY inside
    start()/install helpers, never at module load. If the user never enables
    wake word, none of this touches the app.
  • ZERO latency on the audio path — the microphone callback only ever does a
    cheap, non-blocking queue push (feed()); the actual model inference runs in
    this module's own background thread, so the real-time audio thread and the
    Gemini stream are never slowed.
  • Fully local & offline — audio fed here never leaves the machine; there is no
    network call except the one-time model download the user triggers from the UI.

openwakeword ships small ONNX models (a few MB each) and runs comfortably on a
CPU. The pretrained wake phrase used here is "Hey Jarvis".
